## Projects
### SECURITY EVALUATION OF PATTERN CLASSIFIERS UNDER ATTACK
- **Description:**
  - Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack project that protects users by classifying and detecting harmful threats with the user requirement pattern.
  - It effectively controls harmful threats by minimizing them in a particular pattern.
  - Pattern classification systems based on machine learning algorithms are commonly used in security-related applications like biometric authentication, network intrusion detection, and spam filtering, to discriminate between a â€œlegitimateâ€ and a â€œmaliciousâ€ pattern class (e.g., legitimate and spam emails). Contrary to traditional ones, these applications have an intrinsic adversarial nature since the input data can be purposely manipulated by an intelligent and adaptive adversary to undermine classifier operation. This often gives rise to an arms race between the adversary and the classifier designer. Well-known examples of attacks against pattern classifiers are: submitting a fake biometric trait to a biometric authentication system (spoofing attack); modifying network packets belonging to intrusive traffic to evade intrusion detection systems; manipulating the content of spam emails to get them past spam filters (e.g., by misspelling common spam words to avoid their detection).
